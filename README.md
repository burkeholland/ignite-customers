# Ignite Orders

A sample TypeScript/Express application used in my presentation at Ignite.

Open this project in VS Code. Press Ctrl/Command + Shift + B and select "TypeScript: Watch". This will compile your TypeScript files whenever a change is made.

Change the `README.env` file so that it contains YOUR Cosmos DB connection string. Then rename it to `.env`.

Run this application with the VS Code Debugger.

Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
